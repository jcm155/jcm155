## Joshua Mateer

Hello! My name is Josh! I'm a CS student at Pitt interested in game design and cybersecurity.  
I love playing games, hiking, and just generally being around people.  
I'm currently working on a new engione for easily developing custom interactive fiction games in Python, so stay tuned for future developments in that!  
While at Pitt, I'm mainly involved in a club called [RUF](https://www.rufatpitt.org/). Feel free to check us out!
